<p>  This file is released under the GPLv2.</p>
<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>The Virtual File System (also known as the Virtual Filesystem Switch)<br>is the software layer in the kernel that provides the filesystem<br>interface to userspace programs. It also provides an abstraction<br>within the kernel which allows different filesystem implementations to<br>coexist.</p>
<p>VFS system calls open(2), stat(2), read(2), write(2), chmod(2) and so<br>on are called from a process context. Filesystem locking is described<br>in the document Documentation/filesystems/Locking.</p>
<h2 id="Directory-Entry-Cache-dcache"><a href="#Directory-Entry-Cache-dcache" class="headerlink" title="Directory Entry Cache (dcache)"></a>Directory Entry Cache (dcache)</h2><p>The VFS implements the open(2), stat(2), chmod(2), and similar system<br>calls. The pathname argument that is passed to them is used by the VFS<br>to search through the directory entry cache (also known as the dentry<br>cache or dcache). This provides a very fast look-up mechanism to<br>translate a pathname (filename) into a specific dentry. Dentries live<br>in RAM and are never saved to disc: they exist only for performance.</p>
<p>The dentry cache is meant to be a view into your entire filespace. As<br>most computers cannot fit all dentries in the RAM at the same time,<br>some bits of the cache are missing. In order to resolve your pathname<br>into a dentry, the VFS may have to resort to creating dentries along<br>the way, and then loading the inode. This is done by looking up the<br>inode.</p>
<h2 id="The-Inode-Object"><a href="#The-Inode-Object" class="headerlink" title="The Inode Object"></a>The Inode Object</h2><p>An individual dentry usually has a pointer to an inode. Inodes are<br>filesystem objects such as regular files, directories, FIFOs and other<br>beasts.  They live either on the disc (for block device filesystems)<br>or in the memory (for pseudo filesystems). Inodes that live on the<br>disc are copied into the memory when required and changes to the inode<br>are written back to disc. A single inode can be pointed to by multiple<br>dentries (hard links, for example, do this).</p>
<p>To look up an inode requires that the VFS calls the lookup() method of<br>the parent directory inode. This method is installed by the specific<br>filesystem implementation that the inode lives in. Once the VFS has<br>the required dentry (and hence the inode), we can do all those boring<br>things like open(2) the file, or stat(2) it to peek at the inode<br>data. The stat(2) operation is fairly simple: once the VFS has the<br>dentry, it peeks at the inode data and passes some of it back to<br>userspace.</p>
<h2 id="The-File-Object"><a href="#The-File-Object" class="headerlink" title="The File Object"></a>The File Object</h2><p>Opening a file requires another operation: allocation of a file<br>structure (this is the kernel-side implementation of file<br>descriptors). The freshly allocated file structure is initialized with<br>a pointer to the dentry and a set of file operation member functions.<br>These are taken from the inode data. The open() file method is then<br>called so the specific filesystem implementation can do its work. You<br>can see that this is another switch performed by the VFS. The file<br>structure is placed into the file descriptor table for the process.</p>
<p>Reading, writing and closing files (and other assorted VFS operations)<br>is done by using the userspace file descriptor to grab the appropriate<br>file structure, and then calling the required file structure method to<br>do whatever is required. For as long as the file is open, it keeps the<br>dentry in use, which in turn means that the VFS inode is still in use.</p>
<h1 id="Registering-and-Mounting-a-Filesystem"><a href="#Registering-and-Mounting-a-Filesystem" class="headerlink" title="Registering and Mounting a Filesystem"></a>Registering and Mounting a Filesystem</h1><p>To register and unregister a filesystem, use the following API<br>functions:</p>
<p>   #include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</p>
<p>   extern int register_filesystem(struct file_system_type *);<br>   extern int unregister_filesystem(struct file_system_type *);</p>
<p>The passed struct file_system_type describes your filesystem. When a<br>request is made to mount a filesystem onto a directory in your namespace,<br>the VFS will call the appropriate mount() method for the specific<br>filesystem.  New vfsmount referring to the tree returned by -&gt;mount()<br>will be attached to the mountpoint, so that when pathname resolution<br>reaches the mountpoint it will jump into the root of that vfsmount.</p>
<p>You can see all filesystems that are registered to the kernel in the<br>file /proc/filesystems.</p>
<h2 id="struct-file-system-type"><a href="#struct-file-system-type" class="headerlink" title="struct file_system_type"></a>struct file_system_type</h2><p>This describes the filesystem. As of kernel 2.6.39, the following<br>members are defined:</p>
<p>struct file_system_type {<br>    const char *name;<br>    int fs_flags;<br>        struct dentry *(*mount) (struct file_system_type *, int,<br>                       const char *, void *);<br>        void (*kill_sb) (struct super_block *);<br>        struct module *owner;<br>        struct file_system_type * next;<br>        struct list_head fs_supers;<br>    struct lock_class_key s_lock_key;<br>    struct lock_class_key s_umount_key;<br>};</p>
<p>  name: the name of the filesystem type, such as “ext2”, “iso9660”,<br>    “msdos” and so on</p>
<p>  fs_flags: various flags (i.e. FS_REQUIRES_DEV, FS_NO_DCACHE, etc.)</p>
<p>  mount: the method to call when a new instance of this<br>    filesystem should be mounted</p>
<p>  kill_sb: the method to call when an instance of this filesystem<br>    should be shut down</p>
<p>  owner: for internal VFS use: you should initialize this to THIS_MODULE in<br>      most cases.</p>
<p>  next: for internal VFS use: you should initialize this to NULL</p>
<p>  s_lock_key, s_umount_key: lockdep-specific</p>
<p>The mount() method has the following arguments:</p>
<p>  struct file_system_type *fs_type: describes the filesystem, partly initialized<br>      by the specific filesystem code</p>
<p>  int flags: mount flags</p>
<p>  const char *dev_name: the device name we are mounting.</p>
<p>  void *data: arbitrary mount options, usually comes as an ASCII<br>    string (see “Mount Options” section)</p>
<p>The mount() method must return the root dentry of the tree requested by<br>caller.  An active reference to its superblock must be grabbed and the<br>superblock must be locked.  On failure it should return ERR_PTR(error).</p>
<p>The arguments match those of mount(2) and their interpretation<br>depends on filesystem type.  E.g. for block filesystems, dev_name is<br>interpreted as block device name, that device is opened and if it<br>contains a suitable filesystem image the method creates and initializes<br>struct super_block accordingly, returning its root dentry to caller.</p>
<p>-&gt;mount() may choose to return a subtree of existing filesystem - it<br>doesn’t have to create a new one.  The main result from the caller’s<br>point of view is a reference to dentry at the root of (sub)tree to<br>be attached; creation of new superblock is a common side effect.</p>
<p>The most interesting member of the superblock structure that the<br>mount() method fills in is the “s_op” field. This is a pointer to<br>a “struct super_operations” which describes the next level of the<br>filesystem implementation.</p>
<p>Usually, a filesystem uses one of the generic mount() implementations<br>and provides a fill_super() callback instead. The generic variants are:</p>
<p>  mount_bdev: mount a filesystem residing on a block device</p>
<p>  mount_nodev: mount a filesystem that is not backed by a device</p>
<p>  mount_single: mount a filesystem which shares the instance between<br>      all mounts</p>
<p>A fill_super() callback implementation has the following arguments:</p>
<p>  struct super_block *sb: the superblock structure. The callback<br>      must initialize this properly.</p>
<p>  void *data: arbitrary mount options, usually comes as an ASCII<br>    string (see “Mount Options” section)</p>
<p>  int silent: whether or not to be silent on error</p>
<h1 id="The-Superblock-Object"><a href="#The-Superblock-Object" class="headerlink" title="The Superblock Object"></a>The Superblock Object</h1><p>A superblock object represents a mounted filesystem.</p>
<h2 id="struct-super-operations"><a href="#struct-super-operations" class="headerlink" title="struct super_operations"></a>struct super_operations</h2><p>This describes how the VFS can manipulate the superblock of your<br>filesystem. As of kernel 2.6.22, the following members are defined:</p>
<p>struct super_operations {<br>        struct inode *(*alloc_inode)(struct super_block *sb);<br>        void (*destroy_inode)(struct inode *);</p>
<pre><code>    void (*dirty_inode) (struct inode *, int flags);
    int (*write_inode) (struct inode *, int);
    void (*drop_inode) (struct inode *);
    void (*delete_inode) (struct inode *);
    void (*put_super) (struct super_block *);
    int (*sync_fs)(struct super_block *sb, int wait);
    int (*freeze_fs) (struct super_block *);
    int (*unfreeze_fs) (struct super_block *);
    int (*statfs) (struct dentry *, struct kstatfs *);
    int (*remount_fs) (struct super_block *, int *, char *);
    void (*clear_inode) (struct inode *);
    void (*umount_begin) (struct super_block *);

    int (*show_options)(struct seq_file *, struct dentry *);

    ssize_t (*quota_read)(struct super_block *, int, char *, size_t, loff_t);
    ssize_t (*quota_write)(struct super_block *, int, const char *, size_t, loff_t);
int (*nr_cached_objects)(struct super_block *);
void (*free_cached_objects)(struct super_block *, int);
</code></pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>All methods are called without any locks being held, unless otherwise<br>noted. This means that most methods can block safely. All methods are<br>only called from a process context (i.e. not from an interrupt handler<br>or bottom half).</p>
<p>  alloc_inode: this method is called by alloc_inode() to allocate memory<br>     for struct inode and initialize it.  If this function is not<br>     defined, a simple ‘struct inode’ is allocated.  Normally<br>     alloc_inode will be used to allocate a larger structure which<br>     contains a ‘struct inode’ embedded within it.</p>
<p>  destroy_inode: this method is called by destroy_inode() to release<br>      resources allocated for struct inode.  It is only required if<br>      -&gt;alloc_inode was defined and simply undoes anything done by<br>    -&gt;alloc_inode.</p>
<p>  dirty_inode: this method is called by the VFS to mark an inode dirty.</p>
<p>  write_inode: this method is called when the VFS needs to write an<br>    inode to disc.  The second parameter indicates whether the write<br>    should be synchronous or not, not all filesystems check this flag.</p>
<p>  drop_inode: called when the last access to the inode is dropped,<br>    with the inode-&gt;i_lock spinlock held.</p>
<pre><code>This method should be either NULL (normal UNIX filesystem
semantics) or &quot;generic_delete_inode&quot; (for filesystems that do not
want to cache inodes - causing &quot;delete_inode&quot; to always be
called regardless of the value of i_nlink)

The &quot;generic_delete_inode()&quot; behavior is equivalent to the
old practice of using &quot;force_delete&quot; in the put_inode() case,
but does not have the races that the &quot;force_delete()&quot; approach
had. 
</code></pre>
<p>  delete_inode: called when the VFS wants to delete an inode</p>
<p>  put_super: called when the VFS wishes to free the superblock<br>    (i.e. unmount). This is called with the superblock lock held</p>
<p>  sync_fs: called when VFS is writing out all dirty data associated with<br>      a superblock. The second parameter indicates whether the method<br>    should wait until the write out has been completed. Optional.</p>
<p>  freeze_fs: called when VFS is locking a filesystem and<br>      forcing it into a consistent state.  This method is currently<br>      used by the Logical Volume Manager (LVM).</p>
<p>  unfreeze_fs: called when VFS is unlocking a filesystem and making it writable<br>      again.</p>
<p>  statfs: called when the VFS needs to get filesystem statistics.</p>
<p>  remount_fs: called when the filesystem is remounted. This is called<br>    with the kernel lock held</p>
<p>  clear_inode: called then the VFS clears the inode. Optional</p>
<p>  umount_begin: called when the VFS is unmounting a filesystem.</p>
<p>  show_options: called by the VFS to show mount options for<br>    /proc/<pid>/mounts.  (see “Mount Options” section)</p>
<p>  quota_read: called by the VFS to read from filesystem quota file.</p>
<p>  quota_write: called by the VFS to write to filesystem quota file.</p>
<p>  nr_cached_objects: called by the sb cache shrinking function for the<br>    filesystem to return the number of freeable cached objects it contains.<br>    Optional.</p>
<p>  free_cache_objects: called by the sb cache shrinking function for the<br>    filesystem to scan the number of objects indicated to try to free them.<br>    Optional, but any filesystem implementing this method needs to also<br>    implement -&gt;nr_cached_objects for it to be called correctly.</p>
<pre><code>We can&#39;t do anything with any errors that the filesystem might
encountered, hence the void return type. This will never be called if
the VM is trying to reclaim under GFP_NOFS conditions, hence this
method does not need to handle that situation itself.

Implementations must include conditional reschedule calls inside any
scanning loop that is done. This allows the VFS to determine
appropriate scan batch sizes without having to worry about whether
implementations will cause holdoff problems due to large scan batch
sizes.
</code></pre>
<p>Whoever sets up the inode is responsible for filling in the “i_op” field. This<br>is a pointer to a “struct inode_operations” which describes the methods that<br>can be performed on individual inodes.</p>
<h2 id="struct-xattr-handlers"><a href="#struct-xattr-handlers" class="headerlink" title="struct xattr_handlers"></a>struct xattr_handlers</h2><p>On filesystems that support extended attributes (xattrs), the s_xattr<br>superblock field points to a NULL-terminated array of xattr handlers.  Extended<br>attributes are name:value pairs.</p>
<p>  name: Indicates that the handler matches attributes with the specified name<br>    (such as “system.posix_acl_access”); the prefix field must be NULL.</p>
<p>  prefix: Indicates that the handler matches all attributes with the specified<br>    name prefix (such as “user.”); the name field must be NULL.</p>
<p>  list: Determine if attributes matching this xattr handler should be listed<br>    for a particular dentry.  Used by some listxattr implementations like<br>    generic_listxattr.</p>
<p>  get: Called by the VFS to get the value of a particular extended attribute.<br>    This method is called by the getxattr(2) system call.</p>
<p>  set: Called by the VFS to set the value of a particular extended attribute.<br>    When the new value is NULL, called to remove a particular extended<br>    attribute.  This method is called by the the setxattr(2) and<br>    removexattr(2) system calls.</p>
<p>When none of the xattr handlers of a filesystem match the specified attribute<br>name or when a filesystem doesn’t support extended attributes, the various<br>*xattr(2) system calls return -EOPNOTSUPP.</p>
<h1 id="The-Inode-Object-1"><a href="#The-Inode-Object-1" class="headerlink" title="The Inode Object"></a>The Inode Object</h1><p>An inode object represents an object within the filesystem.</p>
<h2 id="struct-inode-operations"><a href="#struct-inode-operations" class="headerlink" title="struct inode_operations"></a>struct inode_operations</h2><p>This describes how the VFS can manipulate an inode in your<br>filesystem. As of kernel 2.6.22, the following members are defined:</p>
<p>struct inode_operations {<br>    int (*create) (struct inode *,struct dentry *, umode_t, bool);<br>    struct dentry * (*lookup) (struct inode *,struct dentry *, unsigned int);<br>    int (*link) (struct dentry *,struct inode *,struct dentry *);<br>    int (*unlink) (struct inode *,struct dentry *);<br>    int (*symlink) (struct inode *,struct dentry *,const char *);<br>    int (*mkdir) (struct inode *,struct dentry *,umode_t);<br>    int (*rmdir) (struct inode *,struct dentry *);<br>    int (*mknod) (struct inode *,struct dentry *,umode_t,dev_t);<br>    int (*rename) (struct inode *, struct dentry *,<br>            struct inode *, struct dentry *, unsigned int);<br>    int (*readlink) (struct dentry *, char __user *,int);<br>    const char *(*get_link) (struct dentry *, struct inode *,<br>                 struct delayed_call *);<br>    int (*permission) (struct inode *, int);<br>    int (*get_acl)(struct inode *, int);<br>    int (*setattr) (struct dentry *, struct iattr *);<br>    int (*getattr) (const struct path *, struct kstat *, u32, unsigned int);<br>    ssize_t (*listxattr) (struct dentry *, char *, size_t);<br>    void (*update_time)(struct inode *, struct timespec *, int);<br>    int (*atomic_open)(struct inode *, struct dentry *, struct file *,<br>            unsigned open_flag, umode_t create_mode, int *opened);<br>    int (*tmpfile) (struct inode *, struct dentry *, umode_t);<br>};</p>
<p>Again, all methods are called without any locks being held, unless<br>otherwise noted.</p>
<p>  create: called by the open(2) and creat(2) system calls. Only<br>    required if you want to support regular files. The dentry you<br>    get should not have an inode (i.e. it should be a negative<br>    dentry). Here you will probably call d_instantiate() with the<br>    dentry and the newly created inode</p>
<p>  lookup: called when the VFS needs to look up an inode in a parent<br>    directory. The name to look for is found in the dentry. This<br>    method must call d_add() to insert the found inode into the<br>    dentry. The “i_count” field in the inode structure should be<br>    incremented. If the named inode does not exist a NULL inode<br>    should be inserted into the dentry (this is called a negative<br>    dentry). Returning an error code from this routine must only<br>    be done on a real error, otherwise creating inodes with system<br>    calls like create(2), mknod(2), mkdir(2) and so on will fail.<br>    If you wish to overload the dentry methods then you should<br>    initialise the “d_dop” field in the dentry; this is a pointer<br>    to a struct “dentry_operations”.<br>    This method is called with the directory inode semaphore held</p>
<p>  link: called by the link(2) system call. Only required if you want<br>    to support hard links. You will probably need to call<br>    d_instantiate() just as you would in the create() method</p>
<p>  unlink: called by the unlink(2) system call. Only required if you<br>    want to support deleting inodes</p>
<p>  symlink: called by the symlink(2) system call. Only required if you<br>    want to support symlinks. You will probably need to call<br>    d_instantiate() just as you would in the create() method</p>
<p>  mkdir: called by the mkdir(2) system call. Only required if you want<br>    to support creating subdirectories. You will probably need to<br>    call d_instantiate() just as you would in the create() method</p>
<p>  rmdir: called by the rmdir(2) system call. Only required if you want<br>    to support deleting subdirectories</p>
<p>  mknod: called by the mknod(2) system call to create a device (char,<br>    block) inode or a named pipe (FIFO) or socket. Only required<br>    if you want to support creating these types of inodes. You<br>    will probably need to call d_instantiate() just as you would<br>    in the create() method</p>
<p>  rename: called by the rename(2) system call to rename the object to<br>    have the parent and name given by the second inode and dentry.</p>
<pre><code>The filesystem must return -EINVAL for any unsupported or
unknown    flags.  Currently the following flags are implemented:
(1) RENAME_NOREPLACE: this flag indicates that if the target
of the rename exists the rename should fail with -EEXIST
instead of replacing the target.  The VFS already checks for
existence, so for local filesystems the RENAME_NOREPLACE
implementation is equivalent to plain rename.
(2) RENAME_EXCHANGE: exchange source and target.  Both must
exist; this is checked by the VFS.  Unlike plain rename,
source and target may be of different type.
</code></pre>
<p>  get_link: called by the VFS to follow a symbolic link to the<br>    inode it points to.  Only required if you want to support<br>    symbolic links.  This method returns the symlink body<br>    to traverse (and possibly resets the current position with<br>    nd_jump_link()).  If the body won’t go away until the inode<br>    is gone, nothing else is needed; if it needs to be otherwise<br>    pinned, arrange for its release by having get_link(…, …, done)<br>    do set_delayed_call(done, destructor, argument).<br>    In that case destructor(argument) will be called once VFS is<br>    done with the body you’ve returned.<br>    May be called in RCU mode; that is indicated by NULL dentry<br>    argument.  If request can’t be handled without leaving RCU mode,<br>    have it return ERR_PTR(-ECHILD).</p>
<p>  readlink: this is now just an override for use by readlink(2) for the<br>    cases when -&gt;get_link uses nd_jump_link() or object is not in<br>    fact a symlink.  Normally filesystems should only implement<br>    -&gt;get_link for symlinks and readlink(2) will automatically use<br>    that.</p>
<p>  permission: called by the VFS to check for access rights on a POSIX-like<br>      filesystem.</p>
<pre><code>May be called in rcu-walk mode (mask &amp; MAY_NOT_BLOCK). If in rcu-walk
    mode, the filesystem must check the permission without blocking or
storing to the inode.

If a situation is encountered that rcu-walk cannot handle, return
-ECHILD and it will be called again in ref-walk mode.
</code></pre>
<p>  setattr: called by the VFS to set attributes for a file. This method<br>      is called by chmod(2) and related system calls.</p>
<p>  getattr: called by the VFS to get attributes of a file. This method<br>      is called by stat(2) and related system calls.</p>
<p>  listxattr: called by the VFS to list all extended attributes for a<br>    given file. This method is called by the listxattr(2) system call.</p>
<p>  update_time: called by the VFS to update a specific time or the i_version of<br>      an inode.  If this is not defined the VFS will update the inode itself<br>      and call mark_inode_dirty_sync.</p>
<p>  atomic_open: called on the last component of an open.  Using this optional<br>      method the filesystem can look up, possibly create and open the file in<br>      one atomic operation.  If it cannot perform this (e.g. the file type<br>      turned out to be wrong) it may signal this by returning 1 instead of<br>    usual 0 or -ve .  This method is only called if the last component is<br>    negative or needs lookup.  Cached positive dentries are still handled by<br>    f_op-&gt;open().  If the file was created, the FILE_CREATED flag should be<br>    set in “opened”.  In case of O_EXCL the method must only succeed if the<br>    file didn’t exist and hence FILE_CREATED shall always be set on success.</p>
<p>  tmpfile: called in the end of O_TMPFILE open().  Optional, equivalent to<br>    atomically creating, opening and unlinking a file in given directory.</p>
<h1 id="The-Address-Space-Object"><a href="#The-Address-Space-Object" class="headerlink" title="The Address Space Object"></a>The Address Space Object</h1><p>The address space object is used to group and manage pages in the page<br>cache.  It can be used to keep track of the pages in a file (or<br>anything else) and also track the mapping of sections of the file into<br>process address spaces.</p>
<p>There are a number of distinct yet related services that an<br>address-space can provide.  These include communicating memory<br>pressure, page lookup by address, and keeping track of pages tagged as<br>Dirty or Writeback.</p>
<p>The first can be used independently to the others.  The VM can try to<br>either write dirty pages in order to clean them, or release clean<br>pages in order to reuse them.  To do this it can call the -&gt;writepage<br>method on dirty pages, and -&gt;releasepage on clean pages with<br>PagePrivate set. Clean pages without PagePrivate and with no external<br>references will be released without notice being given to the<br>address_space.</p>
<p>To achieve this functionality, pages need to be placed on an LRU with<br>lru_cache_add and mark_page_active needs to be called whenever the<br>page is used.</p>
<p>Pages are normally kept in a radix tree index by -&gt;index. This tree<br>maintains information about the PG_Dirty and PG_Writeback status of<br>each page, so that pages with either of these flags can be found<br>quickly.</p>
<p>The Dirty tag is primarily used by mpage_writepages - the default<br>-&gt;writepages method.  It uses the tag to find dirty pages to call<br>-&gt;writepage on.  If mpage_writepages is not used (i.e. the address<br>provides its own -&gt;writepages) , the PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY tag is<br>almost unused.  write_inode_now and sync_inode do use it (through<br>__sync_single_inode) to check if -&gt;writepages has been successful in<br>writing out the whole address_space.</p>
<p>The Writeback tag is used by filemap<em>wait</em> and sync_page* functions,<br>via filemap_fdatawait_range, to wait for all writeback to complete.</p>
<p>An address_space handler may attach extra information to a page,<br>typically using the ‘private’ field in the ‘struct page’.  If such<br>information is attached, the PG_Private flag should be set.  This will<br>cause various VM routines to make extra calls into the address_space<br>handler to deal with that data.</p>
<p>An address space acts as an intermediate between storage and<br>application.  Data is read into the address space a whole page at a<br>time, and provided to the application either by copying of the page,<br>or by memory-mapping the page.<br>Data is written into the address space by the application, and then<br>written-back to storage typically in whole pages, however the<br>address_space has finer control of write sizes.</p>
<p>The read process essentially only requires ‘readpage’.  The write<br>process is more complicated and uses write_begin/write_end or<br>set_page_dirty to write data into the address_space, and writepage<br>and writepages to writeback data to storage.</p>
<p>Adding and removing pages to/from an address_space is protected by the<br>inode’s i_mutex.</p>
<p>When data is written to a page, the PG_Dirty flag should be set.  It<br>typically remains set until writepage asks for it to be written.  This<br>should clear PG_Dirty and set PG_Writeback.  It can be actually<br>written at any point after PG_Dirty is clear.  Once it is known to be<br>safe, PG_Writeback is cleared.</p>
<p>Writeback makes use of a writeback_control structure to direct the<br>operations.  This gives the the writepage and writepages operations some<br>information about the nature of and reason for the writeback request,<br>and the constraints under which it is being done.  It is also used to<br>return information back to the caller about the result of a writepage or<br>writepages request.</p>
<h2 id="Handling-errors-during-writeback"><a href="#Handling-errors-during-writeback" class="headerlink" title="Handling errors during writeback"></a>Handling errors during writeback</h2><p>Most applications that do buffered I/O will periodically call a file<br>synchronization call (fsync, fdatasync, msync or sync_file_range) to<br>ensure that data written has made it to the backing store.  When there<br>is an error during writeback, they expect that error to be reported when<br>a file sync request is made.  After an error has been reported on one<br>request, subsequent requests on the same file descriptor should return<br>0, unless further writeback errors have occurred since the previous file<br>syncronization.</p>
<p>Ideally, the kernel would report errors only on file descriptions on<br>which writes were done that subsequently failed to be written back.  The<br>generic pagecache infrastructure does not track the file descriptions<br>that have dirtied each individual page however, so determining which<br>file descriptors should get back an error is not possible.</p>
<p>Instead, the generic writeback error tracking infrastructure in the<br>kernel settles for reporting errors to fsync on all file descriptions<br>that were open at the time that the error occurred.  In a situation with<br>multiple writers, all of them will get back an error on a subsequent fsync,<br>even if all of the writes done through that particular file descriptor<br>succeeded (or even if there were no writes on that file descriptor at all).</p>
<p>Filesystems that wish to use this infrastructure should call<br>mapping_set_error to record the error in the address_space when it<br>occurs.  Then, after writing back data from the pagecache in their<br>file-&gt;fsync operation, they should call file_check_and_advance_wb_err to<br>ensure that the struct file’s error cursor has advanced to the correct<br>point in the stream of errors emitted by the backing device(s).</p>
<h2 id="struct-address-space-operations"><a href="#struct-address-space-operations" class="headerlink" title="struct address_space_operations"></a>struct address_space_operations</h2><p>This describes how the VFS can manipulate mapping of a file to page cache in<br>your filesystem. The following members are defined:</p>
<p>struct address_space_operations {<br>    int (<em>writepage)(struct page *page, struct writeback_control *wbc);<br>    int (*readpage)(struct file *, struct page *);<br>    int (*writepages)(struct address_space *, struct writeback_control *);<br>    int (*set_page_dirty)(struct page *page);<br>    int (*readpages)(struct file *filp, struct address_space *mapping,<br>            struct list_head *pages, unsigned nr_pages);<br>    int (*write_begin)(struct file *, struct address_space *mapping,<br>                loff_t pos, unsigned len, unsigned flags,<br>                struct page *</em>pagep, void *<em>fsdata);<br>    int (*write_end)(struct file *, struct address_space *mapping,<br>                loff_t pos, unsigned len, unsigned copied,<br>                struct page *page, void *fsdata);<br>    sector_t (*bmap)(struct address_space *, sector_t);<br>    void (*invalidatepage) (struct page *, unsigned int, unsigned int);<br>    int (*releasepage) (struct page *, int);<br>    void (*freepage)(struct page *);<br>    ssize_t (*direct_IO)(struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *iter);<br>    /</em> isolate a page for migration <em>/<br>    bool (*isolate_page) (struct page *, isolate_mode_t);<br>    /</em> migrate the contents of a page to the specified target */<br>    int (<em>migratepage) (struct page *, struct page *);<br>    /</em> put migration-failed page back to right list */<br>    void (*putback_page) (struct page *);<br>    int (*launder_page) (struct page *);</p>

int (*swap_activate)(struct file *);
int (*swap_deactivate)(struct file *);
</code></pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>  writepage: called by the VM to write a dirty page to backing store.<br>      This may happen for data integrity reasons (i.e. ‘sync’), or<br>      to free up memory (flush).  The difference can be seen in<br>      wbc-&gt;sync_mode.<br>      The PG_Dirty flag has been cleared and PageLocked is true.<br>      writepage should start writeout, should set PG_Writeback,<br>      and should make sure the page is unlocked, either synchronously<br>      or asynchronously when the write operation completes.</p>
<pre><code>  If wbc-&gt;sync_mode is WB_SYNC_NONE, -&gt;writepage doesn&#39;t have to
  try too hard if there are problems, and may choose to write out
  other pages from the mapping if that is easier (e.g. due to
  internal dependencies).  If it chooses not to start writeout, it
  should return AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE so that the VM will not keep
  calling -&gt;writepage on that page.

  See the file &quot;Locking&quot; for more details.
</code></pre>
<p>  readpage: called by the VM to read a page from backing store.<br>       The page will be Locked when readpage is called, and should be<br>       unlocked and marked uptodate once the read completes.<br>       If -&gt;readpage discovers that it needs to unlock the page for<br>       some reason, it can do so, and then return AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE.<br>       In this case, the page will be relocated, relocked and if<br>       that all succeeds, -&gt;readpage will be called again.</p>
<p>  writepages: called by the VM to write out pages associated with the<br>      address_space object.  If wbc-&gt;sync_mode is WBC_SYNC_ALL, then<br>      the writeback_control will specify a range of pages that must be<br>      written out.  If it is WBC_SYNC_NONE, then a nr_to_write is given<br>    and that many pages should be written if possible.<br>    If no -&gt;writepages is given, then mpage_writepages is used<br>      instead.  This will choose pages from the address space that are<br>      tagged as DIRTY and will pass them to -&gt;writepage.</p>
<p>  set_page_dirty: called by the VM to set a page dirty.<br>        This is particularly needed if an address space attaches<br>        private data to a page, and that data needs to be updated when<br>        a page is dirtied.  This is called, for example, when a memory<br>    mapped page gets modified.<br>    If defined, it should set the PageDirty flag, and the<br>        PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY tag in the radix tree.</p>
<p>  readpages: called by the VM to read pages associated with the address_space<br>      object. This is essentially just a vector version of<br>      readpage.  Instead of just one page, several pages are<br>      requested.<br>    readpages is only used for read-ahead, so read errors are<br>      ignored.  If anything goes wrong, feel free to give up.</p>
<p>  write_begin:<br>    Called by the generic buffered write code to ask the filesystem to<br>    prepare to write len bytes at the given offset in the file. The<br>    address_space should check that the write will be able to complete,<br>    by allocating space if necessary and doing any other internal<br>    housekeeping.  If the write will update parts of any basic-blocks on<br>    storage, then those blocks should be pre-read (if they haven’t been<br>    read already) so that the updated blocks can be written out properly.</p>
<pre><code>    The filesystem must return the locked pagecache page for the specified
offset, in *pagep, for the caller to write into.

It must be able to cope with short writes (where the length passed to
write_begin is greater than the number of bytes copied into the page).

flags is a field for AOP_FLAG_xxx flags, described in
include/linux/fs.h.

    A void * may be returned in fsdata, which then gets passed into
    write_end.

    Returns 0 on success; &lt; 0 on failure (which is the error code), in
which case write_end is not called.
</code></pre>
<p>  write_end: After a successful write_begin, and data copy, write_end must<br>        be called. len is the original len passed to write_begin, and copied<br>        is the amount that was able to be copied.</p>
<pre><code>    The filesystem must take care of unlocking the page and releasing it
    refcount, and updating i_size.

    Returns &lt; 0 on failure, otherwise the number of bytes (&lt;= &#39;copied&#39;)
    that were able to be copied into pagecache.
</code></pre>
<p>  bmap: called by the VFS to map a logical block offset within object to<br>      physical block number. This method is used by the FIBMAP<br>      ioctl and for working with swap-files.  To be able to swap to<br>      a file, the file must have a stable mapping to a block<br>      device.  The swap system does not go through the filesystem<br>      but instead uses bmap to find out where the blocks in the file<br>      are and uses those addresses directly.</p>
<p>  invalidatepage: If a page has PagePrivate set, then invalidatepage<br>        will be called when part or all of the page is to be removed<br>    from the address space.  This generally corresponds to either a<br>    truncation, punch hole  or a complete invalidation of the address<br>    space (in the latter case ‘offset’ will always be 0 and ‘length’<br>    will be PAGE_SIZE). Any private data associated with the page<br>    should be updated to reflect this truncation.  If offset is 0 and<br>    length is PAGE_SIZE, then the private data should be released,<br>    because the page must be able to be completely discarded.  This may<br>    be done by calling the -&gt;releasepage function, but in this case the<br>    release MUST succeed.</p>
<p>  releasepage: releasepage is called on PagePrivate pages to indicate<br>        that the page should be freed if possible.  -&gt;releasepage<br>        should remove any private data from the page and clear the<br>        PagePrivate flag. If releasepage() fails for some reason, it must<br>    indicate failure with a 0 return value.<br>    releasepage() is used in two distinct though related cases.  The<br>    first is when the VM finds a clean page with no active users and<br>        wants to make it a free page.  If -&gt;releasepage succeeds, the<br>        page will be removed from the address_space and become free.</p>
<pre><code>The second case is when a request has been made to invalidate
    some or all pages in an address_space.  This can happen
    through the fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) system call or by the
    filesystem explicitly requesting it as nfs and 9fs do (when
    they believe the cache may be out of date with storage) by
    calling invalidate_inode_pages2().
If the filesystem makes such a call, and needs to be certain
    that all pages are invalidated, then its releasepage will
    need to ensure this.  Possibly it can clear the PageUptodate
    bit if it cannot free private data yet.
</code></pre>
<p>  freepage: freepage is called once the page is no longer visible in<br>        the page cache in order to allow the cleanup of any private<br>    data. Since it may be called by the memory reclaimer, it<br>    should not assume that the original address_space mapping still<br>    exists, and it should not block.</p>
<p>  direct_IO: called by the generic read/write routines to perform<br>        direct_IO - that is IO requests which bypass the page cache<br>        and transfer data directly between the storage and the<br>        application’s address space.</p>
<p>  isolate_page: Called by the VM when isolating a movable non-lru page.<br>    If page is successfully isolated, VM marks the page as PG_isolated<br>    via __SetPageIsolated.</p>
<p>  migrate_page:  This is used to compact the physical memory usage.<br>        If the VM wants to relocate a page (maybe off a memory card<br>        that is signalling imminent failure) it will pass a new page<br>    and an old page to this function.  migrate_page should<br>    transfer any private data across and update any references<br>        that it has to the page.</p>
<p>  putback_page: Called by the VM when isolated page’s migration fails.</p>
<p>  launder_page: Called before freeing a page - it writes back the dirty page. To<br>      prevent redirtying the page, it is kept locked during the whole<br>    operation.</p>
<p>  is_partially_uptodate: Called by the VM when reading a file through the<br>    pagecache when the underlying blocksize != pagesize. If the required<br>    block is up to date then the read can complete without needing the IO<br>    to bring the whole page up to date.</p>
<p>  is_dirty_writeback: Called by the VM when attempting to reclaim a page.<br>    The VM uses dirty and writeback information to determine if it needs<br>    to stall to allow flushers a chance to complete some IO. Ordinarily<br>    it can use PageDirty and PageWriteback but some filesystems have<br>    more complex state (unstable pages in NFS prevent reclaim) or<br>    do not set those flags due to locking problems. This callback<br>    allows a filesystem to indicate to the VM if a page should be<br>    treated as dirty or writeback for the purposes of stalling.</p>
<p>  error_remove_page: normally set to generic_error_remove_page if truncation<br>    is ok for this address space. Used for memory failure handling.<br>    Setting this implies you deal with pages going away under you,<br>    unless you have them locked or reference counts increased.</p>
<p>  swap_activate: Called when swapon is used on a file to allocate<br>    space if necessary and pin the block lookup information in<br>    memory. A return value of zero indicates success,<br>    in which case this file can be used to back swapspace.</p>
<p>  swap_deactivate: Called during swapoff on files where swap_activate<br>    was successful.</p>

<p>Again, all methods are called without any locks being held, unless<br>otherwise noted.</p>
<p>  llseek: called when the VFS needs to move the file position index</p>
<p>  read: called by read(2) and related system calls</p>
<p>  read_iter: possibly asynchronous read with iov_iter as destination</p>
<p>  write: called by write(2) and related system calls</p>
<p>  write_iter: possibly asynchronous write with iov_iter as source</p>
<p>  iopoll: called when aio wants to poll for completions on HIPRI iocbs</p>
<p>  iterate: called when the VFS needs to read the directory contents</p>
<p>  iterate_shared: called when the VFS needs to read the directory contents<br>    when filesystem supports concurrent dir iterators</p>
<p>  poll: called by the VFS when a process wants to check if there is<br>    activity on this file and (optionally) go to sleep until there<br>    is activity. Called by the select(2) and poll(2) system calls</p>
<p>  unlocked_ioctl: called by the ioctl(2) system call.</p>
<p>  compat_ioctl: called by the ioctl(2) system call when 32 bit system calls<br>      are used on 64 bit kernels.</p>
<p>  mmap: called by the mmap(2) system call</p>
<p>  open: called by the VFS when an inode should be opened. When the VFS<br>    opens a file, it creates a new “struct file”. It then calls the<br>    open method for the newly allocated file structure. You might<br>    think that the open method really belongs in<br>    “struct inode_operations”, and you may be right. I think it’s<br>    done the way it is because it makes filesystems simpler to<br>    implement. The open() method is a good place to initialize the<br>    “private_data” member in the file structure if you want to point<br>    to a device structure</p>
<p>  flush: called by the close(2) system call to flush a file</p>
<p>  release: called when the last reference to an open file is closed</p>
<p>  fsync: called by the fsync(2) system call. Also see the section above<br>     entitled “Handling errors during writeback”.</p>
<p>  fasync: called by the fcntl(2) system call when asynchronous<br>    (non-blocking) mode is enabled for a file</p>
<p>  lock: called by the fcntl(2) system call for F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW<br>      commands</p>
<p>  get_unmapped_area: called by the mmap(2) system call</p>
<p>  check_flags: called by the fcntl(2) system call for F_SETFL command</p>
<p>  flock: called by the flock(2) system call</p>
<p>  splice_write: called by the VFS to splice data from a pipe to a file. This<br>        method is used by the splice(2) system call</p>
<p>  splice_read: called by the VFS to splice data from file to a pipe. This<br>           method is used by the splice(2) system call</p>
<p>  setlease: called by the VFS to set or release a file lock lease. setlease<br>        implementations should call generic_setlease to record or remove<br>        the lease in the inode after setting it.</p>
<p>  fallocate: called by the VFS to preallocate blocks or punch a hole.</p>
<p>  copy_file_range: called by the copy_file_range(2) system call.</p>
<p>  remap_file_range: called by the ioctl(2) system call for FICLONERANGE and<br>    FICLONE and FIDEDUPERANGE commands to remap file ranges.  An<br>    implementation should remap len bytes at pos_in of the source file into<br>    the dest file at pos_out.  Implementations must handle callers passing<br>    in len == 0; this means “remap to the end of the source file”.  The<br>    return value should the number of bytes remapped, or the usual<br>    negative error code if errors occurred before any bytes were remapped.<br>    The remap_flags parameter accepts REMAP_FILE_* flags.  If<br>    REMAP_FILE_DEDUP is set then the implementation must only remap if the<br>    requested file ranges have identical contents.  If REMAP_CAN_SHORTEN is<br>    set, the caller is ok with the implementation shortening the request<br>    length to satisfy alignment or EOF requirements (or any other reason).</p>
<p>  fadvise: possibly called by the fadvise64() system call.</p>
<p>Note that the file operations are implemented by the specific<br>filesystem in which the inode resides. When opening a device node<br>(character or block special) most filesystems will call special<br>support routines in the VFS which will locate the required device<br>driver information. These support routines replace the filesystem file<br>operations with those for the device driver, and then proceed to call<br>the new open() method for the file. This is how opening a device file<br>in the filesystem eventually ends up calling the device driver open()<br>method.</p>
<h1 id="Directory-Entry-Cache-dcache-1"><a href="#Directory-Entry-Cache-dcache-1" class="headerlink" title="Directory Entry Cache (dcache)"></a>Directory Entry Cache (dcache)</h1><h2 id="struct-dentry-operations"><a href="#struct-dentry-operations" class="headerlink" title="struct dentry_operations"></a>struct dentry_operations</h2><p>This describes how a filesystem can overload the standard dentry<br>operations. Dentries and the dcache are the domain of the VFS and the<br>individual filesystem implementations. Device drivers have no business<br>here. These methods may be set to NULL, as they are either optional or<br>the VFS uses a default. As of kernel 2.6.22, the following members are<br>defined:</p>
<p>struct dentry_operations {<br>    int (*d_revalidate)(struct dentry *, unsigned int);<br>    int (*d_weak_revalidate)(struct dentry *, unsigned int);<br>    int (*d_hash)(const struct dentry *, struct qstr *);<br>    int (*d_compare)(const struct dentry *,<br>            unsigned int, const char *, const struct qstr *);<br>    int (*d_delete)(const struct dentry *);<br>    int (*d_init)(struct dentry *);<br>    void (*d_release)(struct dentry *);<br>    void (*d_iput)(struct dentry *, struct inode *);<br>    char *(*d_dname)(struct dentry *, char *, int);<br>    struct vfsmount *(*d_automount)(struct path *);<br>    int (*d_manage)(const struct path *, bool);<br>    struct dentry *(*d_real)(struct dentry *, const struct inode *);<br>};</p>
<p>  d_revalidate: called when the VFS needs to revalidate a dentry. This<br>    is called whenever a name look-up finds a dentry in the<br>    dcache. Most local filesystems leave this as NULL, because all their<br>    dentries in the dcache are valid. Network filesystems are different<br>    since things can change on the server without the client necessarily<br>    being aware of it.</p>
<pre><code>This function should return a positive value if the dentry is still
valid, and zero or a negative error code if it isn&#39;t.

d_revalidate may be called in rcu-walk mode (flags &amp; LOOKUP_RCU).
If in rcu-walk mode, the filesystem must revalidate the dentry without
blocking or storing to the dentry, d_parent and d_inode should not be
used without care (because they can change and, in d_inode case, even
become NULL under us).

If a situation is encountered that rcu-walk cannot handle, return
-ECHILD and it will be called again in ref-walk mode.
</code></pre>
<p> d_weak_revalidate: called when the VFS needs to revalidate a “jumped” dentry.<br>    This is called when a path-walk ends at dentry that was not acquired by<br>    doing a lookup in the parent directory. This includes “/“, “.” and “..”,<br>    as well as procfs-style symlinks and mountpoint traversal.</p>
<pre><code>In this case, we are less concerned with whether the dentry is still
fully correct, but rather that the inode is still valid. As with
d_revalidate, most local filesystems will set this to NULL since their
dcache entries are always valid.

This function has the same return code semantics as d_revalidate.

d_weak_revalidate is only called after leaving rcu-walk mode.
</code></pre>
<p>  d_hash: called when the VFS adds a dentry to the hash table. The first<br>    dentry passed to d_hash is the parent directory that the name is<br>    to be hashed into.</p>
<pre><code>Same locking and synchronisation rules as d_compare regarding
what is safe to dereference etc.
</code></pre>
<p>  d_compare: called to compare a dentry name with a given name. The first<br>    dentry is the parent of the dentry to be compared, the second is<br>    the child dentry. len and name string are properties of the dentry<br>    to be compared. qstr is the name to compare it with.</p>
<pre><code>Must be constant and idempotent, and should not take locks if
possible, and should not or store into the dentry.
Should not dereference pointers outside the dentry without
lots of care (eg.  d_parent, d_inode, d_name should not be used).

However, our vfsmount is pinned, and RCU held, so the dentries and
inodes won&#39;t disappear, neither will our sb or filesystem module.
-&gt;d_sb may be used.

It is a tricky calling convention because it needs to be called under
&quot;rcu-walk&quot;, ie. without any locks or references on things.
</code></pre>
<p>  d_delete: called when the last reference to a dentry is dropped and the<br>    dcache is deciding whether or not to cache it. Return 1 to delete<br>    immediately, or 0 to cache the dentry. Default is NULL which means to<br>    always cache a reachable dentry. d_delete must be constant and<br>    idempotent.</p>
<p>  d_init: called when a dentry is allocated</p>
<p>  d_release: called when a dentry is really deallocated</p>
<p>  d_iput: called when a dentry loses its inode (just prior to its<br>    being deallocated). The default when this is NULL is that the<br>    VFS calls iput(). If you define this method, you must call<br>    iput() yourself</p>
<p>  d_dname: called when the pathname of a dentry should be generated.<br>    Useful for some pseudo filesystems (sockfs, pipefs, …) to delay<br>    pathname generation. (Instead of doing it when dentry is created,<br>    it’s done only when the path is needed.). Real filesystems probably<br>    dont want to use it, because their dentries are present in global<br>    dcache hash, so their hash should be an invariant. As no lock is<br>    held, d_dname() should not try to modify the dentry itself, unless<br>    appropriate SMP safety is used. CAUTION : d_path() logic is quite<br>    tricky. The correct way to return for example “Hello” is to put it<br>    at the end of the buffer, and returns a pointer to the first char.<br>    dynamic_dname() helper function is provided to take care of this.</p>
<pre><code>Example :

static char *pipefs_dname(struct dentry *dent, char *buffer, int buflen)
&#123;
    return dynamic_dname(dentry, buffer, buflen, &quot;pipe:[%lu]&quot;,
            dentry-&gt;d_inode-&gt;i_ino);
&#125;
</code></pre>
<p>  d_automount: called when an automount dentry is to be traversed (optional).<br>    This should create a new VFS mount record and return the record to the<br>    caller.  The caller is supplied with a path parameter giving the<br>    automount directory to describe the automount target and the parent<br>    VFS mount record to provide inheritable mount parameters.  NULL should<br>    be returned if someone else managed to make the automount first.  If<br>    the vfsmount creation failed, then an error code should be returned.<br>    If -EISDIR is returned, then the directory will be treated as an<br>    ordinary directory and returned to pathwalk to continue walking.</p>
<pre><code>If a vfsmount is returned, the caller will attempt to mount it on the
mountpoint and will remove the vfsmount from its expiration list in
the case of failure.  The vfsmount should be returned with 2 refs on
it to prevent automatic expiration - the caller will clean up the
additional ref.

This function is only used if DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT is set on the
dentry.  This is set by __d_instantiate() if S_AUTOMOUNT is set on the
inode being added.
</code></pre>
<p>  d_manage: called to allow the filesystem to manage the transition from a<br>    dentry (optional).  This allows autofs, for example, to hold up clients<br>    waiting to explore behind a ‘mountpoint’ whilst letting the daemon go<br>    past and construct the subtree there.  0 should be returned to let the<br>    calling process continue.  -EISDIR can be returned to tell pathwalk to<br>    use this directory as an ordinary directory and to ignore anything<br>    mounted on it and not to check the automount flag.  Any other error<br>    code will abort pathwalk completely.</p>
<pre><code>If the &#39;rcu_walk&#39; parameter is true, then the caller is doing a
pathwalk in RCU-walk mode.  Sleeping is not permitted in this mode,
and the caller can be asked to leave it and call again by returning
-ECHILD.  -EISDIR may also be returned to tell pathwalk to
ignore d_automount or any mounts.

This function is only used if DCACHE_MANAGE_TRANSIT is set on the
dentry being transited from.
</code></pre>
<p>  d_real: overlay/union type filesystems implement this method to return one of<br>    the underlying dentries hidden by the overlay.  It is used in two<br>    different modes:</p>
<pre><code>Called from file_dentry() it returns the real dentry matching the inode
argument.  The real dentry may be from a lower layer already copied up,
but still referenced from the file.  This mode is selected with a
non-NULL inode argument.

With NULL inode the topmost real underlying dentry is returned.
</code></pre>
<p>Each dentry has a pointer to its parent dentry, as well as a hash list<br>of child dentries. Child dentries are basically like files in a<br>directory.</p>
<h2 id="Directory-Entry-Cache-API"><a href="#Directory-Entry-Cache-API" class="headerlink" title="Directory Entry Cache API"></a>Directory Entry Cache API</h2><p>There are a number of functions defined which permit a filesystem to<br>manipulate dentries:</p>
<p>  dget: open a new handle for an existing dentry (this just increments<br>    the usage count)</p>
<p>  dput: close a handle for a dentry (decrements the usage count). If<br>    the usage count drops to 0, and the dentry is still in its<br>    parent’s hash, the “d_delete” method is called to check whether<br>    it should be cached. If it should not be cached, or if the dentry<br>    is not hashed, it is deleted. Otherwise cached dentries are put<br>    into an LRU list to be reclaimed on memory shortage.</p>
<p>  d_drop: this unhashes a dentry from its parents hash list. A<br>    subsequent call to dput() will deallocate the dentry if its<br>    usage count drops to 0</p>
<p>  d_delete: delete a dentry. If there are no other open references to<br>    the dentry then the dentry is turned into a negative dentry<br>    (the d_iput() method is called). If there are other<br>    references, then d_drop() is called instead</p>
<p>  d_add: add a dentry to its parents hash list and then calls<br>    d_instantiate()</p>
<p>  d_instantiate: add a dentry to the alias hash list for the inode and<br>    updates the “d_inode” member. The “i_count” member in the<br>    inode structure should be set/incremented. If the inode<br>    pointer is NULL, the dentry is called a “negative<br>    dentry”. This function is commonly called when an inode is<br>    created for an existing negative dentry</p>
<p>  d_lookup: look up a dentry given its parent and path name component<br>    It looks up the child of that given name from the dcache<br>    hash table. If it is found, the reference count is incremented<br>    and the dentry is returned. The caller must use dput()<br>    to free the dentry when it finishes using it.</p>
<h1 id="Mount-Options"><a href="#Mount-Options" class="headerlink" title="Mount Options"></a>Mount Options</h1><h2 id="Parsing-options"><a href="#Parsing-options" class="headerlink" title="Parsing options"></a>Parsing options</h2><p>On mount and remount the filesystem is passed a string containing a<br>comma separated list of mount options.  The options can have either of<br>these forms:</p>
<p>  option<br>  option=value</p>
<p>The &lt;linux/parser.h&gt; header defines an API that helps parse these<br>options.  There are plenty of examples on how to use it in existing<br>filesystems.</p>
<h2 id="Showing-options"><a href="#Showing-options" class="headerlink" title="Showing options"></a>Showing options</h2><p>If a filesystem accepts mount options, it must define show_options()<br>to show all the currently active options.  The rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>options MUST be shown which are not default or their values differ<br>from the default</p>
</li>
<li><p>options MAY be shown which are enabled by default or have their<br>default value</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Options used only internally between a mount helper and the kernel<br>(such as file descriptors), or which only have an effect during the<br>mounting (such as ones controlling the creation of a journal) are exempt<br>from the above rules.</p>
<p>The underlying reason for the above rules is to make sure, that a<br>mount can be accurately replicated (e.g. umounting and mounting again)<br>based on the information found in /proc/mounts.</p>
